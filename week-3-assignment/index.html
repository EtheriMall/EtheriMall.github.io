    <h1><strong>Who am I?</strong></h1>
    <p>Greetings, you may call me Etheri. I'm level 18, born and raised in Ottawa. My specialties include drawing (digital and physical), making drinks, playing video games, and working alone. I dislike olives, programming (ironic, isn't it?), and math. You can easily contact me via email at tiannamallette@gmail.com or at mall0239@algonquinlive.com </p>

    <p>I have weak stats in strength, charisma, and dexterity, but I make up for it with high stats in intelligence, will, constitution, and creativity. To be honest, being level 18 is not like D&D, it feels more like World of Warcraft or Lost Ark. People have lots of potential but limited options at level 18. If this program does not work out for me, I will probably end up becoming a youtuber or something.</p>
